<h1 align="center"><b>Here’s a list of common diseases along with their causes:</b></h1>
<div class="cause">
    1. Diabetes
    Type 1 Diabetes: Autoimmune reaction that destroys insulin-producing cells in the pancreas.
    Type 2 Diabetes: Often linked to obesity, sedentary lifestyle, and genetics, leading to insulin resistance.
    2. Hypertension (High Blood Pressure)
    Causes include obesity, high salt intake, lack of physical activity, and genetics.
    3. Heart Disease
    Risk factors include high cholesterol, high blood pressure, smoking, diabetes, and a sedentary lifestyle.
    4. Asthma
    Caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, including allergens, pollution, and respiratory infections.
    5. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)
    Primarily caused by smoking, long-term exposure to irritants, and genetic factors.
    6. Cancer
    Caused by a combination of genetic predisposition, environmental exposures (like smoking or UV radiation), and lifestyle factors.
    7. HIV/AIDS
    Caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which is transmitted through bodily fluids.
    9. Tuberculosis (TB)
    Caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis, spread through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes.
    10. Malaria
    Caused by parasites transmitted through the bite of infected Anopheles mosquitoes.
    11. Hepatitis
    Viral hepatitis (A, B, C, D, E) can be caused by different viruses, transmitted through contaminated food, water, or blood.
    12. Alzheimer’s Disease
    Causes are not fully understood but involve genetic factors, age, and environmental influences.
    13. Osteoporosis
    Caused by a combination of genetic factors, hormonal changes (especially in postmenopausal women), and lifestyle choices like diet and physical activity.
    14. Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)
    Caused by a weakened lower esophageal sphincter, obesity, diet, and lifestyle factors.
    15. Kidney Disease
    Often caused by diabetes, hypertension, and other conditions that damage the kidneys over time.
